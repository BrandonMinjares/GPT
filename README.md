# GPT3Movies
GPT3 Movies is a web application where people can answer movie trivia questions generated by ChatGPT. I always enjoy playing movie trivia games but eventually the questions run out. This inspired me to create this app. The main bug I'm facing is the prompt given to ChatGPT doesn't always return the same formatted results, making it difficult to parse out the question options and correct answer. The second bug is that every now and then the correct answer being returned in the result isn't the correct answer. Regardless, it's a fun game to play for free.
